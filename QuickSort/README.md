## Efficency

### Time: O(n * log(n))
The basic operation of this algorithm is comparison. This will happen n * log (n) number of times….
### Space: O(1)
No additional space is being created. This array is being sorted in place…keeping the space at constant O(1).


## Solution
You Can Run The Code From App.java main function
