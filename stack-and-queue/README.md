# Stacks and Queues
- Stack is a container of objects that are inserted and removed according to the last-in first-out (LIFO) principle.
- Queue is a container of objects (a linear collection) that are inserted and removed according to the first-in first-out (FIFO) principle.

## Challenge
Make Stack and Queue class from scratch the make methods that make a user can manipulate with data . 

## Approach & Efficiency
- My approach in stack is to make a top pointer thats point to the last element then I can change the data from top . 
- My approach in queue is to make first and last pointer then we can manipulate with data .
