# Singly Linked List
Linked list we can decribe it like  List is a sequence of `Nodes`
each Node references the next Node in the link.

Its how to structure your data . 

## Challenge
My challange about create linked list that you can insert value to it then you can check for any value in the list if it included 
the last things that you can render all value you created it 

## Approach & Efficiency
The approach that I used is about next pointer that check the next node so we can use `While` loop to check the next value if its not null we can do action .

## API
### insert 
The insert method give you the ability to insert value in Listlink.
### include 
The include method give the ability to check value if it exists in your Listlink.
## Append 
This method add node at the end of the list before null . 
## Insert before 
This method accept two parameter one is index that we are looking then we add node before it .
## Insert after
This method accept two parameter one is index that we are looking then we add node after it .
### toString 
The toString method give the ability to retrieve the values in your Listlink in organize way.
